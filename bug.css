The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you try to use `calc()` with a unitless number such as `calc(100% - 10px)` this may work sometimes, but in other cases it might fail unexpectedly, due to the implicit conversion of unitless numbers to pixels or other units which is inconsistent across browsers and CSS properties. In some instances, unitless values within `calc()` might be ignored, causing unexpected layout issues.  Always specify units for all values inside `calc()` to avoid this inconsistency.
